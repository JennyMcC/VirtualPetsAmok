# Virtual Pet description
My virtual pet is a duck named Fiona. I didn't allow the user to change her name because I am selfish and I like the name Fiona. On a scale from 1-100 (with 1 being 'not very' and 100 being 'very'), the user has to deal with her levels of hunger, thirst, fatigue and boredom. She will die if any of those things get over 100.  If any of those things drop below 15 (after the tick) then the game won't allow the user to use that interaction.

Also, I'm referencing a Mitch Hedberg joke, I swear I'm not obsessed with Subway..if you know the joke, let's be best friends.
