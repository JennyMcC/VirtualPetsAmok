# Virtual Pet Amok

I broke my pets into four rosters and called on them by type (Organic dogs, organic cats, robo dogs, robo cats).
 I know there's probably a better way to call on all the pets at once but this is the way I got it to work! If 
any of the organic pets hunger goes over 100, they starve to death and the game ends. Similarly, if any of the
 robo pets oil levels drop below 0, they 'rust to death'. Otherwise, the user can feed, water and walk the pets.
 They can also clean litterboxes and cages, oil the robo pets and adopt a pet.
